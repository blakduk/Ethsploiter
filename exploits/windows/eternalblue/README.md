# Eternal Blue

This exploit uses Microsoft SMB vulnerability. 

For automation of this exploit it is better to use the already prepared payload for executing a command. To change the executed command, a new payload has to be generated - to do that, change the `EXEC_CMD` variable in makefile and build everything again.
